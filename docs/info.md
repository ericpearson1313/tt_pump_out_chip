## How it works

Function: upon power up, and every 24hrs, chip turns on the pump, and using a current transformer (CT) measures the 6 Hz RMS current and observe a current drop indicating the tank has been emptied, or until a timeout has occured and then turn off the pump. Leds indicate status, and button allows starting a pump out operation at any time.

I like to start with a new chip design with a vision, in the form of a technical datasheet.

## How to test

tests are run with 

    make -B

## External hardware

The chip is the control center for the pumpout controller. It connects to:

    - a 2ch ADC with inputs from : ch0: Current Transformer (CT) and ch1: potentiometer
    - 3 output to LEDs
    - 3 inputs from configureation DIP switch
    - 1 input from a push button
    - 1 output to drive a NPN transistor which will engage a relay to power the pump.
